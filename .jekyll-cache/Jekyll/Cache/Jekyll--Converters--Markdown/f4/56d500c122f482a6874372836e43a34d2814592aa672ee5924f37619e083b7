I"Â<p style="text-align: justify;">My name is <strong>W. Jonas Reger</strong> and I am a Senior Undergraduate Student studying Statistics and Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I have also had the pleasure of teaching as a Course Assistant in the Department of Statistics since the Spring Semester of 2019.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a self-taught programmer starting at the age of 15. When I was 17, I interned for the American Cancer Society and led a research project with Dr. Kris Killian in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at UIUC. After that I interned with Andy Loftus, developing applications in Python, at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. After high school, I completed my A.S. Degree in Computer Science at Parkland College. Following that, I transferred into the Statistics program at UIUC to finish my undergraduate degree. I will be graduating with my B.S. in Statistics, with a minor in Mathematics in May 2021. I have been accepted into the Analytics Statistics-M.S. program here at UIUC as well. My research interests include machine learning, signal processing, data &amp; AI ethics, and statistics education.</p>
