<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a self-taught programmer starting at the age of 15. When I was 17, I interned for the American Cancer Society and led a research project with Dr. Kris Killian in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at UIUC. After that I interned with Andy Loftus, developing applications in Python, at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. After high school, I completed my A.S. Degree in Computer Science at Parkland College. Following that, I completed my B.S. Degree in Statistics at UIUC. I am currently working on my M.S. Degree in Analytical Statistics at UIUC as well. My research interests include machine learning, data &amp; AI ethics, statistics education, and signal processing.</p>
