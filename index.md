My name is **W. Jonas Reger** and I am a Senior Undergraduate Student studying Statistics and Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I have also had the pleasure of teaching as a Course Assistant in the Department of Statistics since the Spring Semester of 2019.

I am a self-taught programmer starting at the age of 15. When I was 17, I interned for the American Cancer Society and led a research project with Dr. Kris Killian in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at UIUC. After that I interned with Andy Loftus, developing applications in Python, at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. After high school, I complete my A.S. Degree in Computer Science at Parkland College. Following that, I transferred into the Statistics program at UIUC to finish my undergraduate degree. I will be graduating with my B.S. in Statistics, with a minor in Mathematics in May 2021. I have been accepted into the Analytics Statistics-M.S. program here at UIUC as well. My research interests include machine learning, signal processing, data & AI ethics, and statistics education.
